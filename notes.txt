- Make sure we don't cross filesystem boundries
- save currently processing file to cache
- Add --timemachine option which:
    - Sets up time machine
    - Adds list of default ignored things:
        - .Trash
        - Library/Caches
    - Uses the timestamp on the backup to ignore files created after that time
