- Make sure we don't cross filesystem boundries
- save currently processing file to cache
- save number of files read inside directory to cache
- Add --timemachine option which:
    - Uses the timestamp on the backup to ignore files created after that time
    - Get TimeMachine exclusions from:
        - /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist
        - mdfind "com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'"
     
- Don't recurse into a directory if it doesn't exist on the backup
- Allow patterns to have a '/' suffix to only match directories
- Don't crash if reference files can't be read
